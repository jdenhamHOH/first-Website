	<p>Hello, this is going to be a short list of what I believe to be the top 5 Marvel movies so far. Please enjoy!</p>

<h2>Number 5- The Avengers-(2012)</h2>
<div style="font-style: italic;">
	<p>The movie that signaled the thoughts of OMG, this is really happening! Bringing in all the characters to finally form the fabled Avengers team really incites excitement and is why this movie sits in my top 5. The absolute magnitude and scope makes this a movie a fanboys dream. Plus introducing Thanos as the over-arching main villain! Enough said.</p>

<h2>Number 4- Doctor Strange</h2>
<div style="font-style: italic;">
	<p>Coming in at number 4 is sorcerer supreme himself, Doctor Strange. This movie is visually stunning and with the introduction of magic in MCU, makes it one of best movies to watch. Keeping me on the edge of my seat, this movie constantly dropped my jaw with amazing fight scenes, well placed humor, and a great storyline to go along with it.</p>

<h2>Number 3- Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h2>
<div style="font-style: italic;">
	<p>Captain America movies are what truly holds the marvel universe together. Even though the First Avenger didnt make this list, it still highly regarded as one of the greats as well. Bringing back Caps logtime friend Bucky as the villian of the movie was a great way to bring about a movie that wasn't action packed, but also emotional with him trying to bring his long lost friend back to reality.</p>

<h2>Number 2- Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 1</h2>
<div style="font-style: italic;">
	<p>Guardians of the Galaxy is theh movie that said YES Marvel is going all out on building this huge universe. Doing a more low key team movie was great because it showed that Marvel can make a great movie with any material. Who would have thought that a movie that focused on a talking racoon and living tree would rake in almost a billion dollars. The story is amazing, charaters are fleshed out, and brings a wide scope to the marvel universe. Ronan was on weak on the villians list but did not bring down the movie.</p>

<h2>Number 1- Captain America: Civil War</h2>
<div style="font-style: italic;">
	<p>Here it is. The number 1 movie on list. Having different hereos name dropped throughout movies is one thing, but to literally bring in every hero to date into one film was something we never get see. And to bring the epic comic book arc Civil War to life made every marvel movie goer a bed wetter that day.</p>
